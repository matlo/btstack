#summary This page introduces different HCI UART Transport protocols

= Introduction =
CSR was one of the first vendors to acknowledge that the original HCI UART transport protocol specified by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) contains a fundamental flaw. The problem with the original protocol called *H4* - as it was described in chapter H, section 4 of the Bluetooth specification 1.1 - is that a single bit error can lead to a loss of synchronization between the Bluetooth Host (e.g., a PC or an iPhone) and the Bluetooth Controller (the Bluetooth chipset). Even worse, there is no option to re-synchronize the communication. Therefore, the only remedy is to reset the Bluetooth Controller, which also closes all open connections.

Because of this, CSR added a new transport protocol, the *!BlueCore Serial Protocol (BCSP)* to their chipsets. To overcome the issues of link synchronization and bit errors, BCSP makes use of the *Serial Link Interface Protocol (SLIP)*. The Bluetooth SIG later introduced the new *"Three-wire protocol"*, also called *H5*, presumably based on CSR's BCSP protocol.
