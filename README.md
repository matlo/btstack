btstack
=======
This is a fork of [btstack](https://code.google.com/p/btstack/).  
  
It contains fixes that allowed me to run btstack in Windows.  
I hope these fixes will be merged into the original project.  
I successfully tested btstack built with [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) and [MSYS2/MinGW64](http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/).
